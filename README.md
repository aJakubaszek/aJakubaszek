Welcome to my profile!

I'm Adrian, an indie developer who just graduated his IT University, climbing his way up step by step. My main specialization is Unity, but I also work on .NET desktop app backends and mobile apps in MAUI (though none of them are public).

I have a passion for AI, from building my own small models (mainly neural networks with Keras) to combining large commercial models for more unconventional purposes.

In my repositories, you'll often find a spark of inspirationâ€”non-commercial learning projects that just need a bit of polishing to be fully usable.

Enjoy your stay!
